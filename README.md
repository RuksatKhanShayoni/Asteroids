# Asteroids

This project is a game built with the inspiration from original Asteroids game that was released for arcade machines and developed by ATARI, inc. This game is made of 
OpenGL API and using the C++ language.

The main objective of this game is to achieve scores as high as possible. Here, a player will be able to control a spaceship which can be rotated, can apply 
acceleration and shoot bullets. Some asteroids will float around the screen randomly and the player will shoot the asteroids to attain a score. Upon shooting an 
asteroid it will get broken into smaller sizes and the score attained will depend on the sizes of the asteroids. Besides, a player will be given 3 lives at the 
beginning of the game and losing the 3 lives will result in game over. In case of hitting the spaceship with an asteroid, it will result in losing a life of the player.

There are two other obstacles which are ‘Enemy Ships’ and ‘Space Mines’ which also will affect the player lives upon hit. 

There are two stages in our game player can select a stage in to play the game and upon game over player has option to restart the game.
